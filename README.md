## Personal projects
__[“_Red Cowboy_” (2021)](https://github.com/Bandlou/red-cowboy) – Gameplay, AI, Animation__ 🔴 Unreal 5.0  
A 4-day project where I implemented a basic lock system on Unreal Engine 5.0. NPCs use a behavior tree to freely roam and react to the player's actions. The player can lock an NPC and interact with him.

__[“_Whitewater_” (2021)](https://github.com/Bandlou/whitewater) – Physics__ 🟢 Unity  
A boat simulation prototype. I implemented a system to extract the faces’ data from a boat mesh and used those to implement the boat physics, including buoyancy, water viscosity/drag/friction and air drag.

__[“_Acarew_” (2021)](https://github.com/Bandlou/Acarew) – Computer Graphics__ 🔴 Unreal 5.0  
A marching cubes implementation on Unreal Engine 5. Was working on making the algorithm run on a compute shader. After that, planned to use it to procedually generate terrain and allow the player to alter it at runtime with basic controls.

## University projects
__[“_Valdi & the 4 Seasons_” (2020-2021)](https://github.com/Bandlou/university-projects#valdi--the-4-seasons) – Gameplay Design, Programming (team of 9)__ 🟢 Unity  
A 2D puzzle platformer where you manipulate the seasons. A 9-person project, including artists and sound designers, with regular interdisciplinary meetings. I implemented the season system with the transition effect. I also worked on gameplay, project architecture, player control, camera, sound, and UI.

__[“_Uperqt_” (2021)](https://github.com/Bandlou/university-projects#uperqt---ba-thesis) – Physics, AI__ 🟢 Unity  
An AI capable of controlling an articulated combat robot. I implemented a realistic simulator and used it as a training environment for reinforcement learning. I divided the AI into various behaviours to simplify the problem. This approach gave the robot precise movements and good responsiveness.

__[“_Surviral_” (2020)](https://github.com/Bandlou/university-projects#surviral) – Gameplay Design, Programming (team of 3)__ 🟠 libGDX  
A 2D RTS game where the player takes control of a human immune system to fight a growing infection. I made some immunology research and then the whole team designed the gameplay. I implemented a collision system, the unit recruitment and spawn systems, the bacteria proliferation and attack systems.
