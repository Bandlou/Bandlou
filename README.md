## My recent projects
### [“_Valdi & the 4 Seasons_” (2020-2021) – Gameplay Design, Programming (team of 9)](https://github.com/Bandlou/university-projects#valdi--the-4-seasons)
A 2D puzzle platformer where you manipulate the seasons. A 9-person project, including artists and sound designers, with regular interdisciplinary meetings. I implemented the season system with the transition effect. I also worked on gameplay, project architecture, player control, camera, sound, and UI.

### [“_Whitewater_” (2021) – Physics Programming](https://github.com/Bandlou/whitewater)
A boat simulation prototype. I implemented a system to extract the faces’ data from a boat mesh and used those to implement the boat physics.

### [“_The Art of War_” (2020-2021) – Gameplay Design, Programming](https://github.com/Bandlou/the-art-of-war)
RPG prototype centred on NPCs’ personality and responsiveness. I first designed a character personality model. Then I used it as a base to design and implement a decision system to evaluates choices and a relationship system to evaluates actions.

### [“_Uperqt_” (2021) – Physics Programming, AI Programming](https://github.com/Bandlou/university-projects#uperqt---ba-thesis)
An AI capable of controlling an articulated combat robot. I implemented a realistic simulator and used it as a training environment for reinforcement learning. I divided the AI into various behaviours to simplify the problem. This approach gave the robot precise movements and good responsiveness.

### [“_Surviral_” (2020) – Gameplay Design, Programming (team of 3)](https://github.com/Bandlou/university-projects#surviral)
A 2D RTS game where the player takes control of a human immune system to fight a growing infection. I made some immunology research and then the whole team designed the gameplay. I implemented a collision system, the unit recruitment and spawn systems, the bacteria proliferation and attack systems.
